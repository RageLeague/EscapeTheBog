[h1]Escape The Bog[/h1]

"The bog will be the death of you, if you let it reach your neck."

This mod introduces a mini campaign for Griftlands where you try to escape your inevitable demise. The bog is an unforgiving place, and everything here wants to kill you. Survive, adapt, and solve the mysteries of the bog. You are mostly trying to survive though.

This campaign introduces additional layers of challenges, and its difficulty is above the difficulty of a regular campaign. As such, if you haven't beat the base game, I suggest you beat it first.

This mod is made for Bogtober 2021 (https://bogtober.carrd.co/), and is finished entirely within a month.

* [b]Don't Starve![/b](Get it? Because that's another Klei game? Yeah this one is not particularly clever) There are many challenges when trying to survive in the bog. Not only are you battling outside forces like bog monsters and other people, you are also battling against your own hunger and fatigue. Fail to properly manage them will surely be your downfall.
* [b]Manage Resources![/b] Your resources are very limited in the bog, as there is virtually no opportunity for you to trade with others. You need to use what you have in order to survive. But be warned! Your memories are fading away, and any cards you obtained have limited uses before they are gone forever.
* [b]Explore The Bog![/b] The bog is constantly shifting. Each playthrough, the map of the bog is procedurally generated. Explore while you can, but don't get lost!
* [b]Time Is Limited![/b] When doing virtually anything in the bog, the time passes by. As time goes by, everything around you becomes more and more challenging. Taking too long, and you will be overwhelmed.
* [b]Multiple Endings![/b] I heard people really enjoy games with multiple endings, so I made multiple endings. "Your choices matter"! How exciting, right?
* New items, events, and more!
